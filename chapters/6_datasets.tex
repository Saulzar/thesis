\chapter{Datasets}
\label{chap:datasets} 

In this chapter I introduce the datasets annotated using the tool described in chapter~\ref{chap:design}, describe a little background around each one and examine some statistics. It is left to chapter~\ref{chap:annotation} to  analyse the annotation process used to create these datasets and evaluate the annotation process.
